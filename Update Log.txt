Moved the old coding to "Back code". (Please realize that I won't update those, but they are there in case there exists any discrepancies)
Updated the Set ID
Cards in their new locations have been uploaded.

12/18/2019

All cards have been moved to the new 233xxxxxx code
Baofeng Dragon needs to be coded now, but everything else is there.
May need to correct some old code in case they call specific card names that were shifted...

12/25/2019

Merry Christmas everyone!

Modified the code for Dreamlight Speedstar and Pony Apprentice so they can render 2 different Levels if used to Synchro Summon.
Added coding for Baofeng Dragon - Honghua (will do rest later)
Added a new code to the spreadsheet (Flash Blossom Reindeer / 1224 / 4c8), though I will get to coding them after Baofeng.

1/6/2020

Updated some of the scripts that required specific cards by name (as I forgot to double check that they ran the new codes and not the old ones). Luckily those were in the sets that didn't get their positioning moved. (Ergo, Psychic Dragon Delta Latias, some of the Flyer stuff, etc)

1/8/2020

Moved "Phoenix Guardian" to code "652" so it can be properly marked as a sub-arch of "Guardian" (like that'll ever do much)
Added new versions of the (RELEASE) files that show all the cards in an archetype/series.
Updated pic for Psychic Dragon Eon Princess Latias EX (though it's just fixing the subtype line)
"Baofeng Dragon" monsters should be scripted

1/19/2020

"Blazefur Athlete Fighting Aura" added and coded.
Some of the Diver Equine cards had their scripts modified b/c old effects and stuff, also fixed in the CDB (or should be)

2/1/2020

Added the Flash Blossom Reindeer cards
Fixed some older cards with outdated texts
Fixed some of the old code for Hazmat Animal

Please note that the game won't render out the prompts in CDB; likely due to the 9 digit thing. You may wish to have it open on the side or take notes. They should generally be ordered in the same places they appear on text.

2/3/2020

Fixed the Xyz ZPD monsters because using older code
Added rest of existing Diver Equine monsters
Other small stuff...

2/5/2020

Added new Flash Blossom monster
Fixed some codes here and there

(Will need to add conditions on the Pendulums that can SS themselves from the P-Zone, so you cannot trigger their effects if no spaces to go in.)

Addition of ZP Delta
Fixed some of the Flash Blossom stuff
Some other misc fixes.
Added Rush Duel imports

4/16/2020

As YGOPro is currently being replaced with ED0Pro as of 4/5 (right after I updated this the previous time), I am switching gears for it and coding it for this software.

However, the original code will be kept in back code (YGOPro) if you prefer to still use that version. Just be aware that I won't update it as often.

(Though to be fair, the only things that really changed are likely the codes and some pictures)

That being said though, some of the code may work on YGOPro, but not so much on ED0Pro. If this occurs, please let me know so I can rectify the issue ASAP.

4/19/2020

A few minor code updates, but nothing too serious. Except actually adding code for Blazefur Amaterasu and Ritual (plus pics)

Updated some code so Armades-esque stuff works properly in ED0Pro.
